## 📖 About the Book

In TapTown, every key has a story:

* **Letters Family (A–Z)** live on Alphabet Lane, always buzzing with spelling contests.
* **Numbers Family (0–9)** keep things running in the Counting Tower.
* **Function Keys (F1–F12)** show off their unique skills up on Function Hill.
* **Mr. Escape**, **Ctrl & Alt**, and even the **Spacebar** each play their part in keeping TapTown alive.

This imaginative setup helps kids connect with technology in a friendly, playful way.
